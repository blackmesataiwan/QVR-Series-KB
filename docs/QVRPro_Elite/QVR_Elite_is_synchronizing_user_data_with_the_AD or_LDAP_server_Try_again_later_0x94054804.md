Because QVR Pro Domain User synchronizes once every 24 hours and when system start.

When the above error occurs, you can try to click the refresh button below the user list to manual refresh, and the synchronization of the Domain User will start.

The synchronization time may take up to 1 hour due to the different server performance.
